title: "Talal Zein Award for Joonatan Palmu's poster" 
---

Doctor Joonatan Palmu's e-poster *"Comprehensive Biomarker Profiling of Hypertension in 36,985 Finnish Individuals"* was recognized by the Talal Zein Award at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Hypertension 2022. The award recognizes outstanding work related to the basic science, epidemiology, pathophysiology or therapy of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Joonatan's study investigated associations between serum biomarkers and blood pressure. The study suggests that serum lipids and glucose metabolism abnormalities are connected with hypertension onset.
