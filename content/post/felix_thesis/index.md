title: "Felix Vaura defended his doctoral thesis"

Felix Vaura defended his doctoral thesis *"Phenotypic and genetic subtyping of hypertension â€“ toward personalized hypertension care"*. 
He observed four genetic hypertension components and demonstrated utility of polygenic risk scores in the prediction of hypertension.

High-blood pressure is globally a leading risk factor for mortality, but the current knowledge of phenotypic and genotypic 
hypertension risk factors has not been effectively translated into personalized hypertension care. The aim of this thesis was to explore hypertension
subtyping by applying publicly available supervised and unsupervised subtyping algorithms to large datasets with extensive phenotyping and genotyping.

This thesis support the existence of a hyperglycemic hypertension subtype and robust genetic hypertension subtypes and demonstrate the current ability and future potential of genetics together with methodological development to improve personalized hypertension care.
