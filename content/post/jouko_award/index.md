---

Doctoral Candidate Jouko Nurkkala's abstract *"Association of Polygenic Risk Scores for Pre-Eclampsia and Blood Pressure with Hypertensive Pregnancy Complications"* was recognized by Paul Dudley White International Scholar Award. The award is given to authors with the highest ranked scientific abstract from each country at American Heart Association annual meeting. The study investigates the common genetic background between hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and demonstrates that genetic risk score for blood pressure is strong predictor for pre-eclampsia and other hypertensive pregnancy complications.
